The product is developed as a part of the final year project. It is aimed at providing an architecture and open source code to developers so that they can embed this into their applications to enhance the security. The services provided are top notch and cover the broad spectrum of computer and network security. All the features of the product involve the application of Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques onto the domain of Computer Security.


NEED: The demand for modern tools and techniques to restrict access to applications and services which contain delicate data is increasing exponentially each year. Traditional methods such as PINs, tokens, or passwords fail to keep up with the challenges presented because they can be lost or stolen, which compromises the system security. But even the most powerful cryptographic systems fail to prevent unauthorized access.

AIM: Developers need to adress the issue of security at each module while developing applications involving customer info. The aim of the project is to provide the basic feautures needed to make a system secure. Hence, we have services ranging from Biometric Authentication to Network Intrusion Detection Systems.
